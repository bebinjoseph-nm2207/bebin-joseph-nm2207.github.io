This was my first foray into programming Ik yall be like html and css not programming and you are right. I am referring to javascript. 
But also this is my first exposure to web development and its damn shag but kinda fun too.
Anyways, this project is about understanding india's act east policy.
Lastly, this was for Y2S2 2023 Jan-April. Maybe one day I will look back at this haha I am anyways looking back at this now on 12 March 2024. Alot has happened over the past year, I am grateful for it and looking forward to what the future holds.
