      <h3>Welcome to this datastory! We will explore the effectiveness of a policy by measuring real-life statistics and evaluating it against the policy goal.</h3>
      <h4>Here we go!</h4>
      <p>In 1991, under the vision of Prime Minister Rao, New Delhi launched the "Look East" policy. This policy was aimed at countering Beijing's influence in Southeast Asia.</p>
      <p>There are many ways of arguing how this policy would measure up, so I will specifically explore using the data on Indian and Chinese weapons exports from 1991 (start of the "Look East" policy) to 2022. The idea is to explore the effectiveness of this policy through the lens of defense diplomacy in the area of spreading influence through weapons exports.</p>
      <h5>The button below will generate the barchart showing total Indian arms exports from 1991-2022</h5>

      <h5>The button below will generate the barchart showing total Chinese arms exports from 1991-2022</h5>
      <button>Generate Chinese arms exports</button>
      <p>The data above compares the total arms exports of India & China from 1991-2022 to Southeast Asia. Now, let us breakdown the data by looking at each arms recipient country.</p>
      <p>Further comparison and analysis.</p>
