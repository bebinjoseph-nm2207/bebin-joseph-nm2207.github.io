			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>Hello! Welcome to my data story project for NM2207. Join with me on a brief exploration of making sense
				of a very specific part of Indian Foreign Policy. <br>Now, you might be wondering, what motivated me to
				choose this topic given that South Asian awareness is rather low in Singapore. Well, I took a class on
				South Asian IR and I fondly recall 2 days before my 3000 word essay was due, I met an IR scholar who
				completely disagreed with my essay and this datastory is dedicated to the interaction I had with that
				scholar.</p>

			<h2>Topic</h2>
			<div class="box">
				<div class="box-item"><b>(1)What is the background to my story?</b><br>For several decades, the Indian
					elite have talked alot about countering Chinese influence and I want to see what the Indians have
					done about this.<br>And you see the 4 people here? Well, these are the 4 characters central to the
					background of my datastory.</div>
				<div class="box-item"><b>(2)Who are these folks?</b><br>Clockwise from top left are, Narasimhao Rao,
					Atul Bihari Vajpayee, Narendra Modi, and Manmohan Singh. They were former Prime Ministers of India
					(except Modi, who is the current PM from 2014) and they were all intimately involved with India's
					"Look East" policy.</div>
				<div class="box-item"><b>(3)So, what is the "Look East" policy?</b><br>This policy was launched during
					the tenure of Rao in the 1990s to counter rising Chinese influence by increased engagement with
					Southeast Asia. <br>On a side note, the policy was renamed to "Act East" when Modi became PM in
					2014, but for this datastory, I will refer to this policy as "Look East" as the fundamental
					strategic direction of the policy remains largely the same.</div>
				<div class="box-item"><b>(4)Then what exactly is this datastory about and what am I trying to
						answer?</b><br>Simply put, I am trying to explore whether India has done enough to counter
					Chinese influence since the implementation of this policy.</div>
