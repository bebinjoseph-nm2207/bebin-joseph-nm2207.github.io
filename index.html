        <td><h4>Background:</h4><p>Since the 1990s, in the face of a rising China, the Indian elite embarked on a new policy to "Look East" to connect with Southeast Asia to serve as a counterweight to Beijing's influence in the region. This policy was later renamed to the "Act East" policy in 2014 to suggest a more active engagement. However, there are many different metrics of judging the effectiveness of this policy. For this data story, I will focus on the aspect of defence. And, I will specifically compare the defence-related engagements of India and China with Southeast Asia.</p></td>
        <td><h4>Problem Statement:</h4><p>How has New Delhi provided a counterweight to Beijing's influence in Southeast Asia? I will specifically compare weapons exports from India and China to this region from 1991, start of the policy, to 2014. And from 2014, the start of the Modi administration, to 2022. I will also include Bangladesh and Sri Lanka in my analysis. Although, they are not formally part of Southeast Asia, they are closely linked to it.</p></td>
        <td><h4>Data:</h4><p>I have been very fortunate to collect the data from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI).</p><ul><li>Weapons exports from China between 2004-2022</li><li>Weapons exports from India between 2004-2022</li></ul></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><h4>Findings:</h4><ul><li>Chinese arms transfers exceeds India's over 22 times</li><li>India has only transferred arms to one ASEAN state</li></ul></td>
        <td><h4>Analysis:</h4><p>Preliminary analysis suggests Indian engagement with the region does not match its policy goal of countering China.</p></td>
        <td><h4>Recommendations:</h4><p>Come up with better weapons systems and hire a good sales team.</p></td>
